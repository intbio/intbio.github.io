<td markdown="span"><b>Alexey K. Shaytan, PHD, Dr. Sci., Full Professor, Corr. Memb. RAS - Group Leader</b> <br> Alexey Shaytan is a professor at the Department of Bioengineering, Faculty (School) of Biology, Moscow State Lomonosov University. His research revolves around the application of computational, modeling, engineering, data analysis, and management techniques to understand how living systems work at the molecular level. A particular focus of his research is on understanding how genetic programs encoded in DNA molecules drive the development and functioning of living organisms. Dr. Shaytan received his M.S. and PHD in condensed matter physics from Moscow State University, Russia, Dr. Rer. Nat. (PHD) degree in molecular modeling from the University of Ulm, Germany, and Doctor of Science Degree in computaional biology and bioinforamtics from Moscow State University. He was a post-doctoral visiting fellow at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, NIH, Bethesda USA, where he received training in computational biology and bioinformatics. <br>
